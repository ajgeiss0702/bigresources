# Big Resources
A game using the html5 canvas.

I originally made this in the car with no internet.

You can play the game [here](https://ajgeiss0702.github.io/bigresources/)! I recommend you play it on google chrome, since thats what it was developed on.

I also have google analytics on it, because I want to see how many people use it.
